# DRAW LOTTERY

## SETUP

- No setup, just open the index.html file in your browser to execute the solution

- I was not sure if nodejs, some kind of task-runner/transpiler or any other similar was allowed so I just decided to user plain JavaScript files that run in the browser, and an HTML to render the UI used to enter custom dates.

## EXECUTION

- The UI is prepared to show the next draw lottery from now, in Irish time. Also, it can get the next one given a custom date/time in local time.

- Please feel free to manually change your local computer TZ in order to test the solution.

- All the times are shown in the local time (according to the browser/computer's TZ). The results will be shown based on the Irish draw lottery times (Ireland timezone) but in local time.

## AT

- Only Unit tests

- You can see the AT execution working by opening the index-test.html file in any browser, in the console

- Tests will be separated in two files, each testing one method in different situations

# SUPPORT

- Chrome, Firefox
